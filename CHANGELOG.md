## 2026.2.13 (Unreleased)

### Changes

- Skills: remove duplicate `local-places` Google Places skill/proxy and keep `goplaces` as the single supported Google Places path.
- Discord: send voice messages with waveform previews from local audio files (including silent delivery). (#7253) Thanks @nyanjou.
- Discord: add configurable presence status/activity/type/url (custom status defaults to activity text). (#10855) Thanks @h0tp-ftw.

### Fixes

- Clawdock: avoid Zsh readonly variable collisions in helper scripts. (#15501) Thanks @nkelner.
- Discord: route autoThread replies to existing threads instead of the root channel. (#8302) Thanks @gavinbmoore, @thewilloftheshadow.
- Agents/Image tool: cap image-analysis completion `maxTokens` by model capability (`min(4096, model.maxTokens)`) to avoid over-limit provider failures while still preventing truncation. (#11770) Thanks @detecti1.
- TUI/Streaming: preserve richer streamed assistant text when final payload drops pre-tool-call text blocks, while keeping non-empty final payload authoritative for plain-text updates. (#15452) Thanks @TsekaLuk.
- Inbound/Web UI: preserve literal `\n` sequences when normalizing inbound text so Windows paths like `C:\\Work\\nxxx\\README.md` are not corrupted. (#11547) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Daemon/Windows: preserve literal backslashes in `gateway.cmd` command parsing so drive and UNC paths are not corrupted in runtime checks and doctor entrypoint comparisons. (#15642) Thanks @arosstale.
- Security/Canvas: serve A2UI assets via the shared safe-open path (`openFileWithinRoot`) to close traversal/TOCTOU gaps, with traversal and symlink regression coverage. (#10525) Thanks @abdelsfane.
- Security/Gateway: breaking default-behavior change - canvas IP-based auth fallback now only accepts machine-scoped addresses (RFC1918, link-local, ULA IPv6, CGNAT); public-source IP matches now require bearer token auth. (#14661) Thanks @sumleo.
- Security/Gateway: sanitize and truncate untrusted WebSocket header values in pre-handshake close logs to reduce log-poisoning risk. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Security/WhatsApp: enforce `0o600` on `creds.json` and `creds.json.bak` on save/backup/restore paths to reduce credential file exposure. (#10529) Thanks @abdelsfane.
- WhatsApp: preserve outbound document filenames for web-session document sends instead of always sending `"file"`. (#15594) Thanks @TsekaLuk.
- Security/Gateway + ACP: block high-risk tools (`sessions_spawn`, `sessions_send`, `gateway`, `whatsapp_login`) from HTTP `/tools/invoke` by default with `gateway.tools.{allow,deny}` overrides, and harden ACP permission selection to fail closed when tool identity/options are ambiguous while supporting `allow_always`/`reject_always`. (#15390) Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Security/Browser: constrain `POST /trace/stop`, `POST /wait/download`, and `POST /download` output paths to OpenClaw temp roots and reject traversal/escape paths.
- Gateway/Tools Invoke: sanitize `/tools/invoke` execution failures while preserving `400` for tool input errors and returning `500` for unexpected runtime failures, with regression coverage and docs updates. (#13185) Thanks @davidrudduck.
- MS Teams: preserve parsed mention entities/text when appending OneDrive fallback file links, and accept broader real-world Teams mention ID formats (`29:...`, `8:orgid:...`) while still rejecting placeholder patterns. (#15436) Thanks @hyojin.
- Security/Audit: distinguish external webhooks (`hooks.enabled`) from internal hooks (`hooks.internal.enabled`) in attack-surface summaries to avoid false exposure signals when only internal hooks are enabled. (#13474) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Security/Onboarding: clarify multi-user DM isolation remediation with explicit `openclaw config set session.dmScope ...` commands in security audit, doctor security, and channel onboarding guidance. (#13129) Thanks @VintLin.
- Security/Audit: add misconfiguration checks for sandbox Docker config with sandbox mode off, ineffective `gateway.nodes.denyCommands` entries, global minimal tool-profile overrides by agent profiles, and permissive extension-plugin tool reachability.
- Security/Link understanding: block loopback/internal host patterns and private/mapped IPv6 addresses in extracted URL handling to close SSRF bypasses in link CLI flows. (#15604) Thanks @AI-Reviewer-QS.
- Android/Nodes: harden `app.update` by requiring HTTPS and gateway-host URL matching plus SHA-256 verification, stream URL camera downloads to disk with size guards to avoid memory spikes, and stop signing release builds with debug keys. (#13541) Thanks @smartprogrammer93.
- Auto-reply/Threading: auto-inject implicit reply threading so `replyToMode` works without requiring model-emitted `[[reply_to_current]]`, while preserving `replyToMode: "off"` behavior for implicit Slack replies and keeping block-streaming chunk coalescing stable under `replyToMode: "first"`. (#14976) Thanks @Diaspar4u.
- Sandbox: pass configured `sandbox.docker.env` variables to sandbox containers at `docker create` time. (#15138) Thanks @stevebot-alive.
- Gateway/Restart: clear stale command-queue and heartbeat wake runtime state after SIGUSR1 in-process restarts to prevent zombie gateway behavior where queued work stops draining. (#15195) Thanks @joeykrug.
- Onboarding/CLI: restore terminal state without resuming paused `stdin`, so onboarding exits cleanly after choosing Web UI and the installer returns instead of appearing stuck.
- Auth/OpenAI Codex: share OAuth login handling across onboarding and `models auth login --provider openai-codex`, keep onboarding alive when OAuth fails, and surface a direct OAuth help note instead of terminating the wizard. (#15406, follow-up to #14552) Thanks @zhiluo20.
- Onboarding/Providers: add vLLM as an onboarding provider with model discovery, auth profile wiring, and non-interactive auth-choice validation. (#12577) Thanks @gejifeng.
- Onboarding/Providers: preserve Hugging Face auth intent in auth-choice remapping (`tokenProvider=huggingface` with `authChoice=apiKey`) and skip env-override prompts when an explicit token is provided. (#13472) Thanks @Josephrp.
- OpenAI Codex/Spark: implement end-to-end `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` support across fallback/thinking/model resolution and `models list` forward-compat visibility. (#14990, #15174) Thanks @L-U-C-K-Y, @loiie45e.
- Agents/Codex: allow `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` in forward-compat fallback, live model filtering, and thinking presets, and fix model-picker recognition for spark. (#14990) Thanks @L-U-C-K-Y.
- OpenAI Codex/Auth: bridge OpenClaw OAuth profiles into `pi` `auth.json` so model discovery and models-list registry resolution can use Codex OAuth credentials. (#15184) Thanks @loiie45e.
- Agents/Transcript policy: sanitize OpenAI/Codex tool-call ids during transcript policy normalization to prevent invalid tool-call identifiers from propagating into session history. (#15279) Thanks @divisonofficer.
- Agents/Nodes: harden node exec approval decision handling in the `nodes` tool run path by failing closed on unexpected approval decisions, and add regression coverage for approval-required retry/deny/timeout flows. (#4726) Thanks @rmorse.
- Models/Codex: resolve configured `openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex-spark` through forward-compat fallback during `models list`, so it is not incorrectly tagged as missing when runtime resolution succeeds. (#15174) Thanks @loiie45e.
- macOS Voice Wake: fix a crash in trigger trimming for CJK/Unicode transcripts by matching and slicing on original-string ranges instead of transformed-string indices. (#11052) Thanks @Flash-LHR.
- Heartbeat: prevent scheduler silent-death races during runner reloads, preserve retry cooldown backoff under wake bursts, and prioritize user/action wake causes over interval/retry reasons when coalescing. (#15108) Thanks @joeykrug.
- Outbound targets: fail closed for WhatsApp/Twitch/Google Chat fallback paths so invalid or missing targets are dropped instead of rerouted, and align resolver hints with strict target requirements. (#13578) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Outbound: add a write-ahead delivery queue with crash-recovery retries to prevent lost outbound messages after gateway restarts. (#15636) Thanks @nabbilkhan, @thewilloftheshadow.
- Exec/Allowlist: allow multiline heredoc bodies (`<<`, `<<-`) while keeping multiline non-heredoc shell commands blocked, so exec approval parsing permits heredoc input safely without allowing general newline command chaining. (#13811) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Docs/Mermaid: remove hardcoded Mermaid init theme blocks from four docs diagrams so dark mode inherits readable theme defaults. (#15157) Thanks @heytulsiprasad.
- Outbound/Threading: pass `replyTo` and `threadId` from `message send` tool actions through the core outbound send path to channel adapters, preserving thread/reply routing. (#14948) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Sessions/Agents: pass `agentId` when resolving existing transcript paths in reply runs so non-default agents and heartbeat/chat handlers no longer fail with `Session file path must be within sessions directory`. (#15141) Thanks @Goldenmonstew.
- Sessions/Agents: pass `agentId` through status and usage transcript-resolution paths (auto-reply, gateway usage APIs, and session cost/log loaders) so non-default agents can resolve absolute session files without path-validation failures. (#15103) Thanks @jalehman.
- Sessions: archive previous transcript files on `/new` and `/reset` session resets (including gateway `sessions.reset`) so stale transcripts do not accumulate on disk. (#14869) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Signal/Install: auto-install `signal-cli` via Homebrew on non-x64 Linux architectures, avoiding x86_64 native binary `Exec format error` failures on arm64/arm hosts. (#15443) Thanks @jogvan-k.
- Discord: avoid misrouting numeric guild allowlist entries to `/channels/<guildId>` by prefixing guild-only inputs with `guild:` during resolution. (#12326) Thanks @headswim.
- Config: preserve `${VAR}` env references when writing config files so `openclaw config set/apply/patch` does not persist secrets to disk. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Config: log overwrite audit entries (path, backup target, and hash transition) whenever an existing config file is replaced, improving traceability for unexpected config clobbers.
- Process/Exec: avoid shell execution for `.exe` commands on Windows so env overrides work reliably in `runCommandWithTimeout`. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Web tools/web_fetch: prefer `text/markdown` responses for Cloudflare Markdown for Agents, add `cf-markdown` extraction for markdown bodies, and redact fetched URLs in `x-markdown-tokens` debug logs to avoid leaking raw paths/query params. (#15376) Thanks @Yaxuan42.
- Config: keep legacy audio transcription migration strict by rejecting non-string/unsafe command tokens while still migrating valid custom script executables. (#5042) Thanks @shayan919293.
- Status/Sessions: stop clamping derived `totalTokens` to context-window size, keep prompt-token snapshots wired through session accounting, and surface context usage as unknown when fresh snapshot data is missing to avoid false 100% reports. (#15114) Thanks @echoVic.
- Providers/MiniMax: switch implicit MiniMax API-key provider from `openai-completions` to `anthropic-messages` with the correct Anthropic-compatible base URL, fixing `invalid role: developer (2013)` errors on MiniMax M2.5. (#15275) Thanks @lailoo.

## 2026.2.12

### Changes

- CLI/Plugins: add `openclaw plugins uninstall <id>` with `--dry-run`, `--force`, and `--keep-files` options, including safe uninstall path handling and plugin uninstall docs. (#5985) Thanks @JustasMonkev.
- CLI: add `openclaw logs --local-time` to display log timestamps in local timezone. (#13818) Thanks @xialonglee.
- Telegram: render blockquotes as native `<blockquote>` tags instead of stripping them. (#14608)
- Telegram: expose `/compact` in the native command menu. (#10352) Thanks @akramcodez.
- Discord: add role-based allowlists and role-based agent routing. (#10650) Thanks @Minidoracat.
- Config: avoid redacting `maxTokens`-like fields during config snapshot redaction, preventing round-trip validation failures in `/config`. (#14006) Thanks @constansino.

### Breaking

- Hooks: `POST /hooks/agent` now rejects payload `sessionKey` overrides by default. To keep fixed hook context, set `hooks.defaultSessionKey` (recommended with `hooks.allowedSessionKeyPrefixes: ["hook:"]`). If you need legacy behavior, explicitly set `hooks.allowRequestSessionKey: true`. Thanks @alpernae for reporting.

### Fixes

- Gateway/OpenResponses: harden URL-based `input_file`/`input_image` handling with explicit SSRF deny policy, hostname allowlists (`files.urlAllowlist` / `images.urlAllowlist`), per-request URL input caps (`maxUrlParts`), blocked-fetch audit logging, and regression coverage/docs updates.

- Security/Sandbox: confine mirrored skill sync destinations to the sandbox `skills/` root and stop using frontmatter-controlled skill names as filesystem destination paths. Thanks @1seal.
- Security/Web tools: treat browser/web content as untrusted by default (wrapped outputs for browser snapshot/tabs/console and structured external-content metadata for web tools), and strip `toolResult.details` from model-facing transcript/compaction inputs to reduce prompt-injection replay risk.
- Security/Hooks: harden webhook and device token verification with shared constant-time secret comparison, and add per-client auth-failure throttling for hook endpoints (`429` + `Retry-After`). Thanks @akhmittra.
- Security/Browser: require auth for loopback browser control HTTP routes, auto-generate `gateway.auth.token` when browser control starts without auth, and add a security-audit check for unauthenticated browser control. Thanks @tcusolle.
- Sessions/Gateway: harden transcript path resolution and reject unsafe session IDs/file paths so session operations stay within agent sessions directories. Thanks @akhmittra.

## 2026.1.8

### Highlights

- Security: DMs locked down by default across providers; pairing-first + allowlist guidance.
- Sandbox: per-agent scope defaults + workspace access controls; tool/session isolation tuned.
- Agent loop: compaction, pruning, streaming, and error handling hardened.
- Providers: Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord/Slack reliability, threading, reactions, media, and retries improved.
- Control UI: logs tab, streaming stability, focus mode, and large-output rendering fixes.
- CLI/Gateway/Doctor: daemon/logs/status, auth migration, and diagnostics significantly expanded.

### Breaking

- **SECURITY (update ASAP):** inbound DMs are now **locked down by default** on Telegram/WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage/Discord/Slack.
  - Previously, if you didn’t configure an allowlist, your bot could be **open to anyone** (especially discoverable Telegram bots).
  - New default: DM pairing (`dmPolicy="pairing"` / `discord.dm.policy="pairing"` / `slack.dm.policy="pairing"`).
  - To keep old “open to everyone” behavior: set `dmPolicy="open"` and include `"*"` in the relevant `allowFrom` (Discord/Slack: `discord.dm.allowFrom` / `slack.dm.allowFrom`).
  - Approve requests via `openclaw pairing list <provider>` + `openclaw pairing approve <provider> <code>`.
- Sandbox: default `agent.sandbox.scope` to `"agent"` (one container/workspace per agent). Use `"session"` for per-session isolation; `"shared"` disables cross-session isolation.
- Timestamps in agent envelopes are now UTC (compact `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mmZ`); removed `messages.timestampPrefix`. Add `agent.userTimezone` to tell the model the user’s local time (system prompt only).
- Model config schema changes (auth profiles + model lists); doctor auto-migrates and the gateway rewrites legacy configs on startup.
- Commands: gate all slash commands to authorized senders; add `/compact` to manually compact session context.
- Groups: `whatsapp.groups`, `telegram.groups`, and `imessage.groups` now act as allowlists when set. Add `"*"` to keep allow-all behavior.
- Auto-reply: removed `autoReply` from Discord/Slack/Telegram channel configs; use `requireMention` instead (Telegram topics now support `requireMention` overrides).
- CLI: remove `update`, `gateway-daemon`, `gateway {install|uninstall|start|stop|restart|daemon status|wake|send|agent}`, and `telegram` commands; move `login/logout` to `providers login/logout` (top-level aliases hidden); use `daemon` for service control, `send`/`agent`/`wake` for RPC, and `nodes canvas` for canvas ops.

### Fixes

- **CLI/Gateway/Doctor:** daemon runtime selection + improved logs/status/health/errors; auth/password handling for local CLI; richer close/timeout details; auto-migrate legacy config/sessions/state; integrity checks + repair prompts; `--yes`/`--non-interactive`; `--deep` gateway scans; better restart/service hints.
- **Agent loop + compaction:** compaction/pruning tuning, overflow handling, safer bootstrap context, and per-provider threading/confirmations; opt-in tool-result pruning + compact tracking.
- **Sandbox + tools:** per-agent sandbox overrides, workspaceAccess controls, session tool visibility, tool policy overrides, process isolation, and tool schema/timeout/reaction unification.
- **Providers (Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord/Slack/Signal/iMessage):** retry/backoff, threading, reactions, media groups/attachments, mention gating, typing behavior, and error/log stability; long polling + forum topic isolation for Telegram.
- **Gateway/CLI UX:** `openclaw logs`, cron list colors/aliases, docs search, agents list/add/delete flows, status usage snapshots, runtime/auth source display, and `/status`/commands auth unification.
- **Control UI/Web:** logs tab, focus mode polish, config form resilience, streaming stability, tool output caps, windowed chat history, and reconnect/password URL auth.
- **macOS/Android/TUI/Build:** macOS gateway races, QR bundling, JSON5 config safety, Voice Wake hardening; Android EXIF rotation + APK naming/versioning; TUI key handling; tooling/bundling fixes.
- **Packaging/compat:** npm dist folder coverage, Node 25 qrcode-terminal import fixes, Bun/Playwright/WebSocket patches, and Docker Bun install.
- **Docs:** new FAQ/ClawHub/config examples/showcase entries and clarified auth, sandbox, and systemd docs.

### Maintenance

- Skills additions (Himalaya email, CodexBar, 1Password).
- Dependency refreshes (pi-\* stack, Slack SDK, discord-api-types, file-type, zod, Biome, Vite).
- Refactors: centralized group allowlist/mention policy; lint/import cleanup; switch tsx → bun for TS execution.

## 2026.1.5

### Highlights

- Models: add image-specific model config (`agent.imageModel` + fallbacks) and scan support.
- Agent tools: new `image` tool routed to the image model (when configured).
- Config: default model shorthands (`opus`, `sonnet`, `gpt`, `gpt-mini`, `gemini`, `gemini-flash`).
- Docs: document built-in model shorthands + precedence (user config wins).
- Bun: optional local install/build workflow without maintaining a Bun lockfile (see `docs/bun.md`).

### Fixes

- Control UI: render Markdown in tool result cards.
- Control UI: prevent overlapping action buttons in Discord guild rules on narrow layouts.
- Android: tapping the foreground service notification brings the app to the front. (#179) — thanks @Syhids
- Cron tool uses `id` for update/remove/run/runs (aligns with gateway params). (#180) — thanks @adamgall
- Control UI: chat view uses page scroll with sticky header/sidebar and fixed composer (no inner scroll frame).
- macOS: treat location permission as always-only to avoid iOS-only enums. (#165) — thanks @Nachx639
- macOS: make generated gateway protocol models `Sendable` for Swift 6 strict concurrency. (#195) — thanks @andranik-sahakyan
- macOS: bundle QR code renderer modules so DMG gateway boot doesn't crash on missing qrcode-terminal vendor files.
- macOS: parse JSON5 config safely to avoid wiping user settings when comments are present.
- WhatsApp: suppress typing indicator during heartbeat background tasks. (#190) — thanks @mcinteerj
- WhatsApp: mark offline history sync messages as read without auto-reply. (#193) — thanks @mcinteerj
- Discord: avoid duplicate replies when a provider emits late streaming `text_end` events (OpenAI/GPT).
- CLI: use tailnet IP for local gateway calls when bind is tailnet/auto (fixes #176).
- Env: load global `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/.env` (`~/.openclaw/.env`) as a fallback after CWD `.env`.
- Env: optional login-shell env fallback (opt-in; imports expected keys without overriding existing env).
- Agent tools: OpenAI-compatible tool JSON Schemas (fix `browser`, normalize union schemas).
- Onboarding: when running from source, auto-build missing Control UI assets (`bun run ui:build`).
- Discord/Slack: route reaction + system notifications to the correct session (no main-session bleed).
- Agent tools: honor `agent.tools` allow/deny policy even when sandbox is off.
- Discord: avoid duplicate replies when OpenAI emits repeated `message_end` events.
- Commands: unify /status (inline) and command auth across providers; group bypass for authorized control commands; remove Discord /clawd slash handler.
- CLI: run `openclaw agent` via the Gateway by default; use `--local` to force embedded mode.
